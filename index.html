          might encounter more than a few snares. But not with Hapu. Simply set your rates and our automated payment
          system takes care of the rest. You need never talk money or who owes what.

          A framework built for the long term

        <p>
          Childcare is for the long term. And you need a framework you can
          count on that gives your share long term viability and success.
          That’s why we’ve defined Hapu around our three tribal principles;
          clearly defined process, transparency over money and equality of
          participation.
